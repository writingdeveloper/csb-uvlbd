# HTML5 Canvas Paint Application

I began this project because I had always wanted to make some sort of drawing/whiteboard application. After looking through some options, I decided to go with HTML5 Canvas and brush up on my Javascript skills. So far, the project has a couple of components: 

- Change brush or shape color
- Customize brush
	- Change brush width
	- Change brush style (round, square, rough)
- Switch between brush or shape
	- Shapes: rectangle and triangle
- Erase
- Clear canvas
- Save the artwork as a png file

Of course, itâ€™s definitely still a work in progress, but I am pretty happy with what I made in a few days! I hope to continue by adding more features and fixing any small bugs.
